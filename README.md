# WRDS-Compustat-CRSP-OHLCV-fundamental-data
This repo merges various databases within Compustat north america and CRSP to form the daily OHLCV plus fundamental ratio data for all historical stocks in major indices such as S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, including delisted stocks based on the Compustat/CRSP index constituent history data.

Using this repo will require a WRDS subscription. Also, CRSP data is annually, so only data up to 2022 is provided.

(This is an unfinished prototype. Work-in-progress include calculating adjusted price, total return inclusive of dividend reinvestment, and possible integration with further databases from Compustat and Optionmetrics)
